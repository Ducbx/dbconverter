1. Table and field properties
- A table’s properties are set in the table's property sheet
- A field’s property defines an aspect of the field's behavior
- Every field has a data type which defines the kind of information stored in the field.
- To connect the data stored in different tables, you would create relationships. 
A relationship is a logical connection between two tables that have a common field.

2. Names of fields, controls, and objects in Microsoft Access desktop databases:
- Can be up to 64 characters long.
- Can include any combination of letters, numbers, spaces, and special characters except a period (.), an exclamation point (!), an accent grave (`), and brackets ([ ]).
- Can't begin with leading spaces.
- Can't include control characters (ASCII values 0 through 31).
- Can't include a double quotation mark (") in table, view, or stored procedure names in a Microsoft Access project.

3. primary key
- It uniquely identifies each row
- It is never empty or null — it always contains a value
- The values it contains rarely (ideally, never) change

4. Data types: refer sql data type: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_datatypes.asp

5. List of constraints:
NOT NULL - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value
UNIQUE - Ensures that all values in a column are different
PRIMARY KEY - A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table
FOREIGN KEY - Uniquely identifies a row/record in another table
CHECK - Ensures that all values in a column satisfies a specific condition
DEFAULT - Sets a default value for a column when no value is specified
INDEX - Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly

6. Syntax:https://www.w3schools.com/
- Create DB: CREATE DATABASE databasename;
- Drop DB: DROP DATABASE testDB;
- Create table: 
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    column3 datatype,
   ....
);
- Create table using another table:
CREATE TABLE new_table_name AS
    SELECT column1, column2,...
    FROM existing_table_name
    WHERE ....;
- alter table: 
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name datatype;
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;
ALTER TABLE table_name ALTER COLUMN column_name datatype; (MS Access)
-constraints: 
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype constraint,
    column2 datatype constraint,
    column3 datatype constraint,
    ....
);
- constraints UNIQUE in MS Access: 
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int
);
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    CONSTRAINT UC_Person UNIQUE (ID,LastName)
);
