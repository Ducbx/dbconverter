1. Table and field properties
- A table’s properties are set in the table's property sheet
- A field’s property defines an aspect of the field's behavior
- Every field has a data type which defines the kind of information stored in the field.
- To connect the data stored in different tables, you would create relationships. 
A relationship is a logical connection between two tables that have a common field.
